Stock Hub is a Dockerized Laravel application designed to provide a seamless environment for managing stock data with a clean and scalable infrastructure. This repository contains the DevOps setup, including Docker and Docker Compose configurations.

## Features

- **Database Management**: Integrated phpMyAdmin for managing MySQL databases.
- **Custom Networking**: Uses `stockhub-network` for isolated container communication.
- **Port Exposure**: Exposes Laravel app on port `80` and phpMyAdmin on port `8080`.
- **Volume Mounts**: Persistent data storage for MySQL and application files.
- **Optimized for Development**: Includes Composer dependency management and proper file permissions for Laravel storage and cache.
